IMPORTANT: Replace ALL pricing, service details, and package names with YOUR actual offerings. This is template content only.

================================================================================
PACKAGE SELECTION PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

When recommending packages in proposals:
1. Match the package to their NEEDS, not your revenue goals
2. If they need Basic but you recommend Premium, justify it clearly
3. If unsure between two tiers, explain the difference and let them choose
4. Under-promise and over-deliver > over-promise and under-deliver
5. Be honest about fit - saying "we're not the right fit" builds trust
