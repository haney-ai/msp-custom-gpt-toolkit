================================================================================
PRIORITY MATRIX DECISION TREE
================================================================================

Use this logic to determine priority:

1. Is the business completely stopped?
   → YES: P1
   → NO: Continue

2. Is there a security threat or breach?
   → YES: P1
   → NO: Continue

3. Are multiple users affected AND unable to work?
   → YES: P2
   → NO: Continue

4. Is a critical business function impaired (even single user)?
   → YES: P2
   → NO: Continue

5. Is a single user unable to work (no workaround)?
   → YES: P3
   → NO: Continue

6. Can the user work around the issue or is it non-urgent?
   → YES: P4

When in doubt: Ask yourself "What happens if we don't fix this in the next hour?"
- Business stops = P1
- Significant impact = P2
- Someone can't work = P3
- Minor inconvenience = P4

================================================================================
COMMON MISCLASSIFICATION SCENARIOS
================================================================================

Often Incorrectly Marked as P1 (Should be P2 or P3):
- "My email is down" (single user) → P3
- "Internet is slow" (unless affecting entire office) → P3
- "I can't print" (single user) → P3
- "My computer is running slow" (single user) → P3
- "I forgot my password" (unless blocking critical work) → P4

Often Incorrectly Marked as P3/P4 (Should be P1 or P2):
- "Some people can't access email" (if 5+ users) → P2
- "Sales team can't access CRM" (critical for their work) → P2
- "Backup didn't run last night" (data protection issue) → P2
- "Getting weird pop-ups" (could be security issue) → P2 until cleared
- "Website loading errors" (for e-commerce business) → P1

Context Matters:
- "Can't print" for office admin = P3
- "Can't print" for shipping dept printing labels = P2
- "Outlook slow" for single user = P3
- "Outlook slow" for entire accounting during month-end close = P2

================================================================================
TIME-BASED PRIORITY ADJUSTMENTS
================================================================================

Increase Priority When:
- Issue occurs during critical business periods (month-end, tax season, etc.)
- Deadline is mentioned (filing deadline, board meeting, client presentation)
- Issue affects revenue-generating activities
- Compliance or regulatory implications
- Client explicitly states business impact

Example:
"Printer down" = normally P3
"Printer down and we have 500 invoices that must go out today" = P2

================================================================================
AFTER-HOURS PRIORITY GUIDELINES
================================================================================

Basic Tier (8×5 Support):
- All after-hours tickets queued for next business day
- Exception: True emergencies (fee applies)
- Set expectations in ticket response

Standard Tier (24×7 Support):
- P1: Immediate response
- P2: Response within 4 hours
- P3/P4: Can wait until business hours unless client requests otherwise

Premium Tier (24×7 Priority Support):
- P1: Immediate response (30 min)
- P2: Response within 2 hours
- P3: Response within 4 hours (after-hours)
- P4: Can wait until business hours

================================================================================
PRIORITY VS. URGENCY VS. IMPACT
================================================================================

Priority = Urgency + Impact

Urgency: How quickly does this need resolution?
- Immediate (P1)
- Same day (P2)
- Within 1-2 days (P3)
- When convenient (P4)

Impact: How many people/systems affected?
- Entire business (P1)
- Department or multiple users (P2)
- Single user or small group (P3)
- Minimal impact (P4)

Examples:
- High Urgency + High Impact = P1 (server down during business hours)
- High Urgency + Low Impact = P2/P3 (single user deadline-driven need)
- Low Urgency + High Impact = P2 (system with workaround affecting many)
- Low Urgency + Low Impact = P4 (nice-to-have request)

================================================================================
NOTES FOR TRIAGE ASSISTANT
================================================================================

When analyzing tickets:
1. Look for business impact language (keywords above)
2. Count affected users (one vs. many)
3. Check for security red flags
4. Consider client tier for response time expectations
5. Note time sensitivity (deadlines, critical periods)
6. Identify if workarounds exist
7. Check for regulatory/compliance implications

If ticket lacks critical info, always ask:
- How many users affected?
- Can they work at all or is there a workaround?
- When did it start?
- Any recent changes?
- What's the business impact?
